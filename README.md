# Tech_Blog
This project is a CMS-style blog site where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on othersâ€™ posts. Built from scratch and deployed on Render, the app follows the MVC paradigm, utilizing Handlebars.js for templating, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
